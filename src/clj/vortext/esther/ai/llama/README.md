# llama.clj

Run LLMs locally. A clojure wrapper for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).

## Quick Start

If you're just looking for a model to try things out, try the 3.6Gb [llama2 7B chat model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/tree/main)  from TheBloke. Make sure to check the link for important info like license and use policy.

```sh
mkdir -p models
# Download 3.6Gb model to models/ directory
(cd models && curl -L -O 'https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin')
# mvn-llama alias pulls precompiled llama.cpp libs from maven
clojure -M:mvn-llama -m com.phronemophobic.llama "models/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin" "what is 2+2?"
```

[Overview Guide](https://phronmophobic.github.io/llama.clj/)  
[API Docs](https://phronmophobic.github.io/llama.clj/reference/)  

## Dependency

```clojure
com.phronemophobic/llama-clj {:mvn/version "0.6"}
```

### Native Dependency

llama.clj relies on the excellent [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) library.

The llama.cpp shared library can either be compiled locally or can be included as a standalone maven dependency.

#### Precompiled native deps on clojars

The easiest method is to include the corresponding native dependency for your platform (including multiple is fine, but will increase the size of your dependencies). See the [mvn-llama alias](https://github.com/phronmophobic/llama.clj/blob/b4fef0e8fc23a72349796911cef33d6bbdadcd73/deps.edn#L11) for an example.

```clojure
com.phronemophobic.cljonda/llama-cpp-darwin-aarch64 {:mvn/version "6e88a462d7d2d281e33f35c3c41df785ef633bc1"}
com.phronemophobic.cljonda/llama-cpp-darwin-x86-64 {:mvn/version "6e88a462d7d2d281e33f35c3c41df785ef633bc1"}
com.phronemophobic.cljonda/llama-cpp-linux-x86-64 {:mvn/version "6e88a462d7d2d281e33f35c3c41df785ef633bc1"}
```

#### Locally compiled

Clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp and follow the instructions for building. Make sure to include the shared library options.

_Note: The llama.cpp ffi bindings are based on the `4329d1acb01c353803a54733b8eef9d93d0b84b2` git commit. Future versions of llama.cpp might not be compatible if breaking changes are made. TODO: include instructions for updating ffi bindings._

For Example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
git checkout 4329d1acb01c353803a54733b8eef9d93d0b84b2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Next, include an alias that includes the path to the directory where the shared library is located:
```clojure
;; in aliases
;; add jvm opt for local llama build.
:local-llama {:jvm-opts ["-Djna.library.path=/path/to/llama.cpp/build/"]}
```

### Obtaining models

For more complete information about the models that llama.clj can work with, refer to the [llama.cpp readme](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).

Another good resource for models is [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke) on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/).

## Cli Usage

```sh
clojure -M -m com.phronemophobic.llama <path-to-model> <prompt>
```
Example:

```bash
clojure -M:mvn-llama -m com.phronemophobic.llama "models/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin" "what is 2+2?"
```

## cuBLAS support

For gpu support on linux, cuda must be installed. The instructions for cuda installation can be found in [nvidia's documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/contents.html).

Make sure to restart and follow the [post installation instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#post-installation-actions) so that the cuda development tools like nvcc are available on the path.

Currently, pre-compiled binaries of llama.cpp with cuBLAS support are not available. The llama.cpp native dependencies must be [compiled locally](#locally-compiled) with `-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON` as argument. Something like:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
git checkout 4329d1acb01c353803a54733b8eef9d93d0b84b2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
