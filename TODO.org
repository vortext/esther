* Progress
** TODO use client context `now` for memory sql dates
** TODO documentation
** TODO play with models
** TODO Implement websockets for chat
** TODO llama.cpp parallel mode
** TODO embeddings for RAG
- onnx bert?
- bert.cpp / jna?
- wait for llama.cpp to fix it?
** TODO embeddings for memory retrieval and context
- Add memories during converse into associative mem
- Retrieve similar memories (if any) => guids (associate)
- For prompt: frecency keywords => memories by keyword => most_similar => summarize top-k => context: {kw: summary}
- For converse: most_similar => summarize top-k => context: {kw: summary}
- Inject similar memories in user request context
- https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib (via JNA clong clang?)
- https://github.com/vioshyvo/mrpt (no persistence)
- get it to work simple example
- get it to work persistence, how to deal with scoping to user?!
- get it to work with embeddings and real data (find or generate some dataset)
- summarize using simple lexrank?
- how to generate the proper amount of context? (summarization???)
** TODO a way to serialize "personality"
** TODO daily scheduled tasks: sleep, dream, clean (integrate quartz)
** TODO export / download data functionality (for me and GDPR!)
** TODO /forget <last|random> <n> command
** TODO /context command
** TODO figure out a sane way to do multi user scalably
- check if there's a distributed deploy strategy that supports mirostat ðŸ™ƒ
- https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy (needs bigger GPU to quantize)
- https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm (doesn't support quantization at all)
** TODO UI/UX things
- [X] Discoverability of input bar --- Maybe show imagination?
- [X] Nicer / intelligent placeholder?
- [ ] Button for archive or other commands?
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Logo + favicon
- [X] Loading indicator login
- [ ] Accessibility and ARIA
- [X] Disable text input while in modal confirm
** TODO test infrastructure and tests => generate training / test data for fine tuning
** TODO better intro flow
** TODO /help command
** TODO sign-up page
** TODO calendar page (for memories)?
** TODO #keyword search
** TODO semantic search memories
** TODO share a page (static gen)
** TODO security and hosting
** TODO deploy and build shizzle (Github actions?)
** TODO app? legal, ethics, billing, subscriptions, etc.
* Ideas for later
** TODO finetune model
** TODO link parsing in that it downloads the page and adds it as context
** TODO image upload (img-to-text?)
** TODO offline desktop app?
** TODO /imagine command (no solutions for this ATM)
- maybe stablediffusion v0.9 (new version)
- hook up image generation (StableDiffusionAPI is too crappy)
- integrate image describe into memory
- https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF maybe?
- store description and image in memory contents
- use image describe as context for converse
- stablediffusion locally?
** TODO integrate https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise for NER or for the lulz?
