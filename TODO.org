* Really TODO
** TODO use client context `now` for memory sql dates
** TODO documentation (docstring & readmes)
** TODO Dockerfile (#sadface)
** TODO do not use JSON for Esther responses (no need really with gbnf constraints)
- It confuses the llm as it pushes the logits towards json garbage, rather than natural language
** TODO Implement websockets for chat
** TODO llama.cpp parallel decode?
** TODO test infrastructure and tests => generate training / test data for fine-tuning
** TODO embeddings for RAG (memory retrieval for context)
- onnx bert?
- bert.cpp / jna?
- using llama.cpp embeddings directly?
- Add memories during converse into associative mem
- Retrieve similar memories (if any) => guids (associate)
- For prompt: frecency keywords => memories by keyword => most_similar => summarize top-k => context: {kw: summary}
- For converse: most_similar => summarize top-k => context
- Inject similar memories in user request context
- https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib (via JNA clong clang?)
- https://github.com/vioshyvo/mrpt (no persistence)
- get it to work simple example
- get it to work persistence, how to deal with scoping to user?!
- get it to work with embeddings and real data (find or generate some dataset)
- summarize using simple lexrank on imaginations?
- how to generate the proper amount of context? (summarizing???)
** TODO export / download data functionality (for me and the GDPR!)
** TODO when login code crashes for some reason the app should give UI feedback
** TODO /context command
** TODO UI/UX things
- [X] Discoverability of input bar --- Maybe show imagination?
- [X] Nicer / intelligent placeholder?
- [ ] Button for archive or other commands?
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Logo + favicon
- [X] Loading indicator login
- [ ] Accessibility and ARIA
- [X] Disable text input while in modal confirm
** TODO better intro flow
** TODO /help command
** TODO sign-up page
** TODO calendar page (for memories)
** TODO #keyword search
** TODO semantic search memories
** TODO share a page (static gen)
** TODO security and hosting
** TODO deploy and build shizzle (Github actions?)
** TODO app? legal, ethics, billing, subscriptions, etc.
* Ideas for later
** TODO finetune model
** TODO link parsing in that it downloads the page and adds it as context
** TODO image upload (img-to-text?)
** TODO offline desktop app?
** TODO /imagine command (no solutions for this ATM)
- StableDiffusion locally?
- maybe StableDiffusion v0.9 (new version)
- integrate image describe into memory
- https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF maybe?
- store description and image in memory contents
- use image describe as context for converse
** TODO integrate https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise for NER or for the lulz?
** TODO Simularca for data generation / simulations
